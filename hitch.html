    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <h4>Getting dating advice is easy.. getting the right advice is hard.</h4>
      <p>The world of dating is hard. Everybody knows that.. especially if you’re a single person in their early 30s like me. How do you know if what you’re doing is right for you?</p>
          <p>Asking a friend can be a safe option, but do they really know what they are talking about? And what if you’re too embarrassed to look your friend in the eye and tell them about your personal issues? Online articles can be useful for confirmation, but also can be too generic in their approach... I’m not just another reader with a copy and paste problem. And then there’s the dating coach.. The confidential professional, who’s entire life is dedicated to the art of dating and relationships. Besides offering their services for an eye-watering amount of money, how do you know if they are any good or not? I did find myself scrolling through dozens of dating coach websites, but how do you compare them?</p>
            <p>But wait..
            Can’t you just ask for advice on community apps like Reddit, Quora or any other dating advice site?
            Well I’m glad you asked.. Let us begin this journey!
            To the Batmobile!</p>

          <h2>Understand</h2>
          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>I started by conducting a competitor analysis on online dating advice sites or apps.. and what I found during my initial Google search, shocked me. There really isn’t much out there in terms of online dating advice sites.. Which got me thinking..
            WHY? Is it because people don’t want to use online dating advice sites?
            Or is it because they don’t exist in the first place? A classic which came first, chicken or the egg, situation. Well the chicken came first obviously. How could an egg just magically appear out of thin air??
            Ok, we might be going off track here..
             Back to the competitor analysis.
              For this analysis, I only picked sites that allowed users to ask dating/relationship specific questions - Community apps like Reddit and Quora, where users can ask questions anonymously to the community, as well as dating advice sites where a user can send questions to a vetted dating coach.</p>

              <div>
                <p>What did I find?
                  From my competitor analysis, it was clear that the community apps are very popular and heavily used (Reddit has over 52m daily users and over 700K twitter followers) but these apps are not specific to dating and relationships - They have specific sub-communities but since there is no vetting of responses, any unqualified person could answer your question. The anonymity of everyone would also open you up to online abuse from trolls.. No one should have to put up with this.
                  The current dating advice sites I found all allowed users to ask vetted coaches, but the UI was outdated, with images of middle aged people, and the UX was poorly designed. It was clear that these sites were targeting the the >40yrs age demographic - these sites also all had next to no brand awareness and poor social media marketing and engagement which confirmed this theory.
                  Surely there was an opportunity for some middle ground?</p>

                <h2>Observe</h2>
                <h3>User Survey</h3>
                <p>I then wanted to find out people’s habits, pain points and general attitudes when it came to getting dating advice. Where do people currently get dating advice? Do they generally get good advice from these sources? Have they ever looked online for advice? I surveyed 30 people to see if I could find out.</p>

                </picture>
                <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>To take these findings further, I conducted 3 user interviews with people from my personal network, to find out about their habits when it came to getting dating advice. I wanted to dive deeper into understanding user behaviour around getting dating advice.</p>
                 <picture>
                  <source srcset="img/hitch/interview_findings.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

                 </picture>
                 <p>From my research, it was clear that people generally don’t look online for dating advice, preferring to ask friends or family. However, a large part of this was down to there being NO SOLUTIONS currently out there.
                    So.. I had to ask myself a big question..
                    Should I even continue with this project? ABSOLUTELY, YES! People didn’t want a tablet until it was created for them (as of 2021, over 1.28 billion people own a tablet) - Therefore, with the right UX and a well executed design, I felt as though it was more than worth pursuing.
                    What features should the app have?
                    After conducting the surveys and interviews, I was able to make the decision on 4 core features that the app would have.

                  <h3>User Personas</h3>
                  <p>
                    Using the insights taken from my User Research analysis, I was able to identify 3 personas at 3 different stages of their life.
                    Based on my research, it was clear relationships are a very important part of people’s lives and so it is important for both single people and people in relationships to get good advice.

                    <h2>Ideate</h2>
                    <h3>User Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                      With the users and their goals in mind, I created a user journey map for each persona. With this, I was able to really put myself into the shoes of the personas and empathise with them.
                      At this point, it was becoming clearer on what the app would provide and who I was designing it for. Now it was time to visualise these ideas and concepts into a working site infrastructure. I decided to create user flows for each persona, and conduct a card sorting exercise to validate my site-map.
                    </p>

                    <h3>User Flows</h3>
                    <p>In order to get a better understanding of how the personas would potentially use the app, I created user flows designed to meet specific user objectives. I found this to be an invaluable exercise where I could really see what success would mean for the user.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Refining the Sitemap and Card Sorting</h3>
                      <p>The information that I gathered from the card sorting was extremely beneficial - it confirmed the majority of my 4 main category groupings and it also gave me a few additional ideas to think about. The three main changes I made to my sitemap were to combine the ‘Send a message’ function with the ‘Video chat with expert’ function into one category. This made much more sense for the user since they first decide that they want to interact with an expert, and then it is followed by how they want to interact. The other two changes were to rename ‘Blogs & Articles’ to ‘Resources’ and ‘Previously answered questions’ to ‘Community’ which provides a more collective mentality for the user experience.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Site Map</h3>
                      <p>Based on the results of the card sorting exercise, I designed a site map to form the main structure of the app.

                      <h2>Prototype</h2>
                      <h3>Paper Sketching</h3>
                      <p>
                        After analysing all the data from my card sorting, I went about creating low-fidelity wireframes with simple pencil and paper - this way I could create them quickly and easily make changes. I created wireframes for 4 specific tasks based on the core features that I had decided to base the app around.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wire-framing & Prototyping</h3>
                      <p>
                        Once I had finalised my paper wireframes, I moved onto creating mid-fidelity wireframes using Figma. This was a great learning experience to start to think about padding, button sizes and font sizes etc. But most of all, it was awesome to start to learn all the different prototyping functions in Figma - a great learning curve!
                        With this Mid-Fidelity prototype, I planned on testing with real users - based on the feedback I received, I would then reiterate my designs and create a final prototype design.

                      <h2>Test</h2>
                      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                      <p>I conducted 5 usability tests for my dating advice app, Hitch - all remote moderated via Zoom. To make sure I got a variety of perspectives I did tests with 2 males and 3 females with a varied age demographic. My participants were recruited from both the UK and abroad and I made a conscious effort to include people from different ethnicities.

                      <h3>Reiterations</h3>
                      <p>
                        With these test key findings, it was time to make some iterations to the design - It was here when I realised just how valuable usability testing is, since it lets you see simple and easily fixable issues that you may have missed previously.

                      <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                      <p>With my wireframes complete, it was time to start putting together the look and feel of the app through visual design.
                        I made the decision to use a warm colour palette to promote friendliness and openness - two key feels of the app. I also wanted to make sure that the app’s UI was simple so that the user would have minimal distractions away from what really mattered - the content itself.

                      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                      <p>I learned 3 valuable lessons from this project:</P>
                      <p>  All feedback in invaluable (stakeholder, user, peer). Whether I agreed with the feedback given or not, one thing I definitely learnt is that getting constant feedback on my designs helped me evaluate my design decisions, as well as discover new angles and critical errors.</p>
                      <p>  Designs are living products and constantly improve. One of the biggest lessons I learned was that the design process requires constant feedback loops and iterations. A design can always be improved, and so it must be treated as a living thing - something can always be made easier for the user!</p>
                      <p>  Stay organised! The design process can be a long process to follow, but by keeping all the documents and deliverables organised from the very start, means an immense amount of time is saved in the later parts of the process.</p>
